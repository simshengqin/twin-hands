# Poker Grid - Godot-Ready Refactor

## What Changed?

Your entire codebase has been refactored into a **Godot-ready architecture** that follows Godot 4.5 best practices. The game logic is now structured exactly how it would be in Godot Engine.

## New Structure

```

## Key Learnings Applied

### 1. Resource-Based Data
- **Card, Hand, Config** → Custom Resources
- Serializable as `.tres` files
- No logic, just data + signals

### 2. Node-Based Controllers
- **GameManager, GridManager, ScoreManager** → Nodes
- Coordinate different systems
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. Global Event Bus
- **Events** → Autoload singleton
- Decouples all systems
- Signal-driven architecture

### 4. Separation of Concerns
```
Resources    → Pure data (Card, GameState)
Managers     → Game logic (GameManager, GridManager)
Utils        → Static helpers (PokerEvaluator)
Autoload     → Global systems (Events)
```

## Testing the New Architecture

The new code is **100% functional** in Python:

```bash
python run_godot_ready.py
```

This runs your game with the new architecture, using a UI adapter to bridge with the existing terminal interface.

## Main Components

### Resources (`godot_src/resources/`)
- `card_resource.py` - Playing card data
- `game_config_resource.py` - Configuration
- `game_state_resource.py` - Game state with signals
- `grid_cell_resource.py` - Individual cell
- `reel_resource.py` - Deck reel per column

### Managers (`godot_src/managers/`)
- `game_manager.py` - Main coordinator
- `grid_manager.py` - Grid operations (dealing, freezing)
- `score_manager.py` - Scoring logic

### Utils (`godot_src/utils/`)
- `poker_evaluator.py` - Hand evaluation
- `card_factory.py` - Deck creation

### Autoload (`godot_src/autoload/`)
- `events.py` - Global event bus with all game signals

## Architecture Highlights

### Signal-Driven Communication
Instead of direct method calls, systems communicate via signals:

```python
# Old way
game.score_and_update()
ui.update_score()

# New way
Events.emit_score_updated(current, cumulative)
# UI automatically reacts via signal connection
```

### Modular Managers
Instead of one giant GameStateManager:

```python
# Old: One class does everything
game_state_manager.play_hand()
game_state_manager.score_grid()
game_state_manager.auto_freeze()

# New: Specialized managers
game_manager.play_hand()      # Coordinates
grid_manager.deal_grid()      # Handles grid
score_manager.score_grid()    # Handles scoring
```

### Resource Pattern
Data is separated from logic:

```python
# Old: Mixed data + logic
class Card:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
    def get_value(self):
        return RANK_VALUES[self.rank]

# New: Pure data
class CardResource:
    rank: str
    suit: str
    # Logic is elsewhere (PokerEvaluator)
```

## Porting to Godot

When you're ready to port to Godot Engine:

1. **Read**: `GODOT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Understand the structure
2. **Follow**: `PORTING_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step instructions
3. **Convert**: Python → GDScript (syntax changes only)
4. **Create**: UI scenes with signals
5. **Connect**: Everything via Events autoload

The architecture is **already Godot-ready**. You just need to:
- Change syntax (Python → GDScript)
- Create visual scenes (currently terminal UI)
- Add polish (animations, sounds, effects)

## Code Comparison

### Before (models.py)
```python
@dataclass
class Card:
    rank: str
    suit: str

class GameStateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = GameState(...)
        self.config = Config()

    def play_hand(self):
        # 50 lines of code
        ...

    def score_grid(self):
        # 30 lines of code
        ...
```

### After (godot_src/)
```python
# resources/card_resource.py
class CardResource:
    rank: str
    suit: str

# managers/game_manager.py
class GameManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.grid_manager = GridManager(...)
        self.score_manager = ScoreManager(...)

    def play_hand(self):
        Events.emit_hand_started()
        self.grid_manager.deal_grid()
        Events.emit_hand_completed()

# managers/score_manager.py
class ScoreManager:
    def score_grid(self):
        # Focused scoring logic
        ...
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Easier to Port**
Direct 1-to-1 mapping to Godot concepts

### 2. **More Maintainable**
Each class has a single responsibility

### 3. **More Extensible**
Add features without touching existing code

### 4. **Better Testable**
Test each manager independently

### 5. **Signal-Driven**
Natural for UI updates and game events

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [x] Test new architecture: `python run_godot_ready.py`
- [x] Review documentation: `GODOT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] Understand signal flow

### When Ready to Port
- [ ] Install Godot 4.5

## Questions?

### Q: Does the original code still work?
**A:** Yes! `run.py` still works with the original architecture.

### Q: Can I use the new code now?
**A:** Yes! Run `python run_godot_ready.py` to test it.

### Q: What's the main difference?
**A:** Structure. The logic is the same, but organized like Godot expects.

### Q: How much work to port to Godot?
**A:** Mostly syntax changes + creating UI scenes. The architecture is already correct.

### Q: Can I modify the new code?
**A:** Absolutely! It's structured to be easy to extend and modify.

## Summary

Your codebase has been **completely refactored** into a Godot-ready structure based on:
1. Godot 4.5 deck builder tutorial patterns
2. Godot best practices (Resources, Nodes, Signals)
3. Professional game architecture principles

Everything is **documented**, **tested**, and **ready to port** when you are!
