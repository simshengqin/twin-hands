  What We ACTUALLY Want to Know:

  Simple Question:
  "What is the probability distribution of poker hands when players can reroll columns?"

  That's it! No quota, no top-3, no cumulative scoring.

  The Real Simulation:

  Simulate 100k grids:

  Scenario 0: No rerolls (baseline)
  ├─ Deal 5×5 grid
  ├─ Evaluate 10 hands (5 rows + 5 cols)
  └─ Record hand types

  Scenario 1: 1 reroll
  ├─ Deal 5×5 grid
  ├─ Smart reroll 1 column (which improves grid most)
  ├─ Evaluate 10 hands
  └─ Record hand types

  Scenario 2: 2 rerolls
  ├─ Deal 5×5 grid
  ├─ Smart reroll 2 columns
  ├─ Evaluate 10 hands
  └─ Record hand types

  Scenario 3: 3 rerolls
  ├─ Deal 5×5 grid
  ├─ Smart reroll 3 columns
  ├─ Evaluate 10 hands
  └─ Record hand types

  Output:

  For each scenario (0, 1, 2, 3 rerolls):

  Hand Distribution:
  - High Card: X%
  - One Pair: Y%
  - Two Pair: Z%
  - ...
  - Royal Flush: 0.0X%

  Stats per grid:
  - Min/Max/Median/Mean of each hand type per grid

  Comparison:
                    0 Rerolls  1 Reroll  2 Rerolls  3 Rerolls
  High Card           45.2%      42.1%      38.5%      35.2%
  One Pair            38.5%      39.2%      37.8%      36.1%
  Two Pair             8.3%       9.1%      10.5%      11.8%
  Three of a Kind      4.2%       4.8%       5.6%       6.5%
  Flush                2.1%       2.5%       3.2%       4.1%
  Full House           1.1%       1.5%       2.1%       2.9%
  ...

  Shows: "How much does each reroll improve hand quality?"

  Reroll Strategy (Simplified):

  def smart_reroll(grid, num_rerolls):
      """
      For each reroll:
      1. Evaluate all 10 hands
      2. Find which column contributes to most low-value hands
      3. Reroll that column
      4. Repeat
      """

  Much simpler! No top-3 logic needed!

  Confirmed Spec:

  - ✅ 100k grids per scenario
  - ✅ 4 scenarios (0, 1, 2, 3 rerolls)
  - ✅ Track all 10 hands per grid
  - ✅ Report distribution + stats (min/max/median/mean)
  - ✅ Compare scenarios side-by-side
  - ❌ No quota scoring
  - ❌ No top-3 filtering
  - ❌ No cumulative anything
