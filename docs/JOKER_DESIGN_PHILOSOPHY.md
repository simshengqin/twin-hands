## The 10 Principles of Joker Design

### 1. Jokers should have a theme
**Theme = Visual + Name + Effect connection**

The theme should be cohesive across:
- Visual design
- Card name
- Mechanical effect

**Good examples from Balatro:**
- **Delayed Gratification** - Wait for payoff (visual + effect match)
- **Pareidolia** - Seeing faces in patterns (visual + effect match)
- **Gros Michel** - Banana that goes extinct (visual + effect match)

**For Twin Hands:**
- Joker should tell a story through its art, name, and what it does
- Players should "get it" at a glance

---

### 2. Jokers should have ONE effect
**Effect = Primary bonus + Optional condition**

**Allowed structure:**
- Effect: `+4 mult`
- Effect + Condition: `+4 mult if played hand contains X`

**NOT allowed:**
- Multiple unrelated effects on one Joker
- Example: DON'T add "straights can wrap around Ace" to a Joker that already does something else

**Why:**
- Keeps effects clear and readable
- Prevents power creep
- Makes synergies predictable

---

### 3. Powerful effects should be conditional
**Power = Harsh tradeoffs**

Strong Jokers need drawbacks or strict conditions.

**Why:**
- Creates interesting A/B choices
- Drawbacks can synergize with other mechanics
- Makes deckbuilding decisions meaningful
- Prevents "always correct" picks

**Examples:**
- High mult BUT only if you play specific hand type
- Huge bonus BUT requires setup
- Scales well BUT conditional trigger

---

### 4. Jokers should generally "fit in"
**Boring is good. Wacky is rare.**

**Design principle:**
- Most Jokers: Reliable, straightforward, "boring"
- Few Jokers: Totally unique, wacky, game-warping

**Why:**
- Boring Jokers are reliable anchors
- Not tied to oppressive conditions
- Make wacky Jokers feel special by contrast
- Diversity of power levels = diversity of strategies

**For Twin Hands:**
- Common/Uncommon: Simple, reliable
- Rare: Interesting conditions
- Legendary: Game-warping uniqueness

---

### 5. Jokers shouldn't always be the "right choice"
**No auto-picks. Choices matter.**

If a Joker is ALWAYS correct on an average run, it's poorly designed.

**Why:**
- Game is about meaningful A/B choices
- If choice is 100% obvious, decision disappears
- Context should matter (current build, deck state, etc.)

**Design test:**
- "Is there a situation where I DON'T want this Joker?"
- If answer is "never", redesign it

---

### 6. Descriptions should be SHORT (≤3 lines)
**If you can't explain it briefly, scrap it.**

**Why:**
- Attention span is limited
- Wall of text = players don't read
- Brevity forces simplicity
- Short descriptions = broader synergy potential

**For Twin Hands:**
- Target: 1-2 lines for Common/Uncommon
- Max: 3 lines for Rare/Legendary
- If it takes longer to describe, idea is too complex

---

### 7. Descriptions should be SIMPLE
**"Written in crayon" rule**

If the creator finds it complex, players will find it unintelligible.

**Design test:**
- Could a 10-year-old understand this?
- Can you explain it without using jargon?
- Does it require reading twice?

**LocalThunk's note:** *"This is the one I struggle with the most"*

---

### 8. Synergize with KEYWORDS, not specific Jokers
**Broad synergy, not narrow combos**

**GOOD - Synergizes with keywords:**
- "Face cards"
- "Flushes"
- "Pairs"
- "Spades"

**BAD - Synergizes with specific Jokers:**
- "Works with [Joker Name]"
- Requires specific other Jokers to function

**Why:**
- Broad keywords = many synergies
- Specific combos = frustratingly rare in large pool
- Emergent synergy happens naturally
- Pool expansion doesn't dilute synergies
- **No Joker Exodia** (5-card combo requirements)

---

### 9. Work with EXISTING mechanics, don't introduce new ones
**Avoid mechanic creep**

Jokers should augment core keywords/stats, not add entirely new systems.

**Why:**
- New mechanics dilute existing synergies
- Players have to learn new rules
- Increases complexity exponentially
- Harder to balance

**For Twin Hands core mechanics:**
- Hand types (Pair, Flush, Straight, etc.)
- Points, Mult
- Decks, Trading
- Play tokens, Trade tokens

**Jokers should modify these, not add new concepts**

---

### 10. Visual consistency (Art guidelines)
**Jokers should look like a cohesive set**

**Rules:**
- All Jokers contain the word "Joker" in the art
- **Exception:** Legendary Jokers only
- Consistent art style across all Jokers
- Similar color palette for cohesion

**Why:**
- Players recognize Jokers instantly
- Visual consistency = professional polish
- Legendary Jokers feel special by breaking the rule

---

## Application to Twin Hands

### Phase B (Current)
- Start with **simple, boring, reliable Jokers**
- Common tier: flat bonuses, basic conditions
- Test the philosophy with 3-5 basic Jokers first

### Phase C (Expansion)
- Add Uncommon/Rare with interesting conditions
- Introduce 1-2 "wacky" Legendary Jokers
- Ensure no auto-picks exist

### Design Checklist
Before adding a Joker, verify:
- ✅ Has clear theme (visual + name + effect)
- ✅ Has ONE effect (not multiple unrelated bonuses)
- ✅ Powerful effects have conditions/drawbacks
- ✅ Fits in (not every Joker is wacky)
- ✅ Not always the "right choice"
- ✅ Description ≤3 lines
- ✅ Description is simple (crayon-readable)
- ✅ Synergizes with keywords, not specific Jokers
- ✅ Uses existing mechanics, no new systems
- ✅ Visual consistency (contains "Joker" in art)
