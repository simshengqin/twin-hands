## About This Game

Twin Hands is a poker roguelike about building two engines that multiply each other.

Your 52-card deck splits into two 26-card decks. Play poker hands from both sides. Combine their scores to beat ever-rising quotas. Upgrade hands globally. Stack Jokers that trigger twice â€” once for each deck â€” and watch your numbers spiral out of control.

**Bridge Jokers activate twice per round** â€” one trigger for the left deck, one for the right. Stack them to fuel both engines simultaneously.

**Trade cards between decks mid-round.** Shift your aces, complete flushes, and fine-tune both hands from a shared pool.

**Upgrade hands globally with Planet Packs.** Boost Flush from 20 â†’ 50 points. Both decks benefit instantly.

Every choice doubles in power.
Every Joker purchase affects both sides.
Every hand upgrade boosts both decks.
The deeper you go, the faster it spirals.

**Example progression:**
Round 1 â†’ Score 26 points to beat 300.
Round 8 â†’ Score 1,890 points to beat 1,882.
Exponential growth, exponential chaos.

**The Hook Test:**
If someone asks "Why not just play Balatro?", the answer is:
**"Because in Balatro you build ONE broken hand. In Twin Hands you build TWO broken hands that multiply each other. Bridge Jokers trigger for both. Planet Packs buff both. Every decision affects both. It's exponential chaos instead of linear scaling."**
