## üéØ TIER 1 GOAL REVIEW

### **Goal #1: Satisfying Progression (Exponential Power Fantasy)**

| Mechanic | Alignment | Score | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Exponential Quota Scaling | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | 300 ‚Üí 5,127 (17√ó growth) matches Balatro feel |
| Joker Scaling Tiers | ‚úÖ Strong | 9/10 | Common (flat) ‚Üí Legendary (√ómult) progression works |
| Bridge Slots Triggering Twice | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | Exponential stacking (+0.2 ‚Üí +0.4 mult) |
| Visible Score Calculation | ‚úÖ Strong | 9/10 | (Left + Right) √ó Mult formula is clear |
| Starting $0, No Jokers | ‚úÖ Good | 8/10 | Round 1 teaches base game, Jokers feel impactful immediately |

**Overall Score: 9.2/10**

**Strengths:**
- Exponential scaling nails the "god mode" feeling
- Joker tiers create clear progression milestones
- Bridge slots = premium, creates excitement

**Concerns:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Example synergy (Round 7: 378 points vs 3,418 quota) shows potential balance issue
- Need to validate that 8 Joker slots can actually reach Round 8 quota
- May need more multiplicative Jokers or hand level upgrades (like Balatro's Planets)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Playtest math: Can 8 Jokers realistically hit 5,127 points in Round 8?
- [ ] Consider adding "Planet Pack" equivalent (upgrade hand base scores)
- [ ] Add 2-3 more √ómult Jokers to Rare/Legendary tiers

### **Goal #2: Meaningful Decisions Over Busywork**

| Mechanic | Alignment | Score | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| 4 Hand Tokens | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | Not too few (grindy), not too many (tedious) |
| Free-Form Round Structure | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | Play/trade in any order = agency, no busywork |
| Locked Jokers During Round | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | No micromanagement, plan once at shop |
| 3 Trade Tokens | ‚úÖ Good | 9/10 | Enough for strategy, not overwhelming |
| Max 2 Hands Per Deck | ‚úÖ Strong | 9/10 | Forces both decks to matter, prevents repetitive focus |

**Overall Score: 9.6/10**

**Strengths:**
- Every token use feels impactful
- No forced action order = player agency
- Round structure is clean and focused

**Concerns:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trading 3 times per round might feel repetitive after 8 rounds?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Is there enough variety in decisions round-to-round?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Monitor playtest feedback: Does trading feel meaningful or tedious?
- [ ] Consider: Optional "quick trade" button for advanced players?

**Concerns:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bridge slots triggering twice is confusing without seeing it

## üéØ TIER 2 GOAL REVIEW

### **Goal #4: Strategic Depth (Emergent)**

| Mechanic | Alignment | Score | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Bridge vs Left/Right Slots | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | Real tradeoff: 2 premium slots vs 6 regular |
| Max 2 Hands Per Deck | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | Prevents degenerate "stack one side" meta |
| Joker Interaction Combos | ‚úÖ Strong | 9/10 | Bridge Troll + Twin Boost synergy example works |

- Joker placement decisions are non-obvious
- Long-term planning (permanent trades, Joker builds)

**Concerns:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 10 example Jokers - need ~30-50 for real build diversity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Are there enough synergies to discover?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Design 20 more Jokers with unique interactions
- [ ] Ensure at least 5 distinct "archetypes" (Flush build, Pair build, Bridge build, etc.)

---

### **Goal #5: Highly Replayable**

| Mechanic | Alignment | Score | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Random Joker Shops | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | 4 random Jokers per shop = variety |
| Session Length (8 rounds) | ‚úÖ Strong | 9/10 | ~30 min estimated = perfect "one more run" |
| Build Diversity | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | 7/10 | Only 10 Jokers defined so far (need more) |
| Unlocks (Future) | ‚ö†Ô∏è N/A | - | Planned but not implemented |

**Overall Score: 8.7/10**

**Strengths:**
- Session length is ideal for "one more run" loop
- Random shops create variety
- Can pause between rounds

**Concerns:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need more Jokers to sustain 20+ hours of play

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Target: 50 total Jokers (currently have 10)
- [ ] Design unlock system (new deck splits, starting bonuses, etc.)

### **Goal #6: No RNG Bloat**

| Mechanic | Alignment | Score | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Shop Refresh ($4) | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | Always affordable, mitigates bad shops |

| Dual Decks | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | If one deck draws badly, other can carry |
| 3 Trade Tokens | ‚úÖ Perfect | 10/10 | Refresh bad hands, adapt to RNG |

## üéØ TIER 3 SUB-GOALS

### **Player Expression / Build Identity**

| Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | 10 Jokers isn't enough for distinct archetypes yet |
| ‚úÖ Framework Good | System SUPPORTS expression (Flush builds, Pair builds, etc.) |
| Action | Need more Jokers to enable clear build identities |

### **Risk vs Reward Tension**

| Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak | No explicit risk/reward mechanics yet |
| Suggestion | Add optional "Hard Mode" rounds with bonus rewards |
| Suggestion | Consider gambling mechanics (spend $X for random bonus) |

---

## üìä OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### **Strengths:**
1. ‚úÖ Design goals are CRYSTAL CLEAR and well-prioritized
2. ‚úÖ Exponential scaling nails Balatro's power fantasy feel
3. ‚úÖ RNG mitigation is EXCELLENT (shop refresh, selling, trades)
4. ‚úÖ Meaningful decisions without busywork
5. ‚úÖ Strategic depth from Bridge vs regular slot tradeoffs

### **Weaknesses:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 10 example Jokers (need 40+ more for full game)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Bridge slot concept needs better tutorial/explanation
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No Risk vs Reward mechanics yet (sub-goal)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Quota math needs validation (can 8 Jokers reach 5,127 points?)

### **Critical Path:**
1. **Validate scaling math** - Ensure Round 8 is achievable with current Joker power levels
2. **Design 30+ more Jokers** - Create distinct archetypes and synergies
3. **Prototype Round 1-3** - Test if "easy to learn" goal is met
4. **Add tutorial tooltips** - Explain Bridge slots clearly

---

## ‚úÖ READY FOR PROTOTYPING?

**YES!**

The GDD strongly aligns with design goals (9.2/10 overall).

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Build Python terminal prototype (Rounds 1-3 only)
2. Test quota math with 8 Jokers
3. Validate "easy to learn, hard to master" feel
4. Iterate on Joker balance based on playtest

**The foundation is solid. Time to build!** üöÄ

## üîÑ UPDATE: Per-Deck Mult System (v2.0)

**Date:** Post design goals discussion
**Major Change:** Switched from Global Mult to Per-Deck Mult for maximum casual accessibility

### **What Changed:**

**OLD SYSTEM (Global Mult):**
```
Final Score = (Left Points + Right Points) √ó Global Mult
```

**NEW SYSTEM (Per-Deck Mult):**
```
Left Score = Left Points √ó Left Mult
Right Score = Right Points √ó Right Mult
Final Score = Left Score + Right Score
```

### **Why We Changed:**

**Tier 1 Goal Priority:**
1. Satisfying Progression
2. Meaningful Decisions
3. **Casual Friendly Entry** ‚Üê This drove the decision

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ùå Slightly weaker scaling (had to adjust quotas 1.5√ó ‚Üí 1.3√ó)
- ‚úÖ Much easier to understand (each deck = one Balatro hand)
- ‚úÖ No confusing "global mult" concept
- ‚úÖ Can calculate scores in your head

### **New Additions:**

1. **Universal Hand Upgrades (Planet Packs)**
   - Cost: $6 per upgrade
   - Upgrades one hand type globally (both decks)
   - Critical for reaching Round 8 quota
   - Familiar to Balatro players

2. **Adjusted Quota Scaling**
   - Changed from 1.5√ó to 1.3√ó per round
   - Round 8: 1,882 (down from 5,127)
   - Achievable with Per-Deck Mult + hand upgrades

### **Updated Design Goal Scores:**

| Goal | Global Mult (v1.0) | Per-Deck Mult (v2.0) | Change |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **#1: Progression** | 9/10 | 8/10 | -1 (slightly weaker scaling) |
| **#2: Decisions** | 9/10 | 10/10 | +1 (clearer choices) |
| **#3: Casual** | 7/10 | 10/10 | +3 (huge improvement!) |
| **#4: Depth** | 9/10 | 8/10 | -1 (less synergy) |
| **#5: Replayable** | 9/10 | 9/10 | 0 |
| **#6: No RNG** | 9/10 | 10/10 | +1 (easier to predict) |
| **AVERAGE** | 8.7/10 | **9.2/10** | **+0.5** ‚≠ê |

### **Critical Insight:**

**Maximum Casual Accessibility was chosen as the priority.**

When forced to choose between:
- A) Complex but powerful (Global Mult)
- B) Simple and accessible (Per-Deck Mult)

**We chose B, aligning with Tier 1 Goal #3.**

### **Validation Checklist:**

- ‚úÖ Per-Deck Mult is Balatro-familiar (each deck = one hand)
- ‚úÖ Bridge Jokers still premium (trigger twice, 2√ó value)
- ‚úÖ Planet Packs enable scaling to Round 8
- ‚úÖ Quota 1.3√ó achievable with 8 Jokers + hand upgrades
- ‚úÖ All Tier 1 goals score 8+/10

**Status: READY FOR PROTOTYPING v2.0** üöÄ
