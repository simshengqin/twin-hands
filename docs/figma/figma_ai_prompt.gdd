🟦 Figma AI Prompt — “Twin Hands (v4 — Sorted Decks + Unified Interactivity)”

Recreate the attached screenshot faithfully, upgrading it to include all new functionality and systems below.

🎮 Game Context

Twin Hands is a roguelike poker game with two linked decks (Left = Blue, Right = Magenta).
Each deck builds its own Chips × Mult score, and both share a unified resource pool (Hands, Discards, Trades).

⚙️ Layout

Two decks, spaced ≈5 px apart.

Shared center column for Jokers, resources, and total score.

Background: #0a0e1a → #121828 → #0a0e1a.

Left deck glows blue, right deck glows magenta.

🃏 Deck Structure

Each deck contains:

3 full-size Jokers (top row).

Score panel with Chips × Mult.

7 clickable poker cards, large and well-spaced (≥ 24 px gap).

Buttons below: Play, Discard, Rank, Suit

Rank and Suit are smaller utility buttons (right-aligned).

Buttons use per-deck color accents (blue or magenta).

🧮 Sorting Behavior

Each deck maintains its own sorting preference.

Rank button → Sorts ascending by rank (9 → 10 → J → Q → K → A).

If ranks tie, sort by suit (♠ → ♥ → ♦ → ♣).

Suit button → Sorts ascending by suit, then by rank.

Sorting animates smoothly (0.25 s reorder).

🟡 Central Column
Shared Resources
Hands   4 / 4   |   Discards   4 / 4   |   Trades   2 / 2

💡 Highlight System (Final Behavior)
Core Principle

Highlights can appear in both decks simultaneously, updating dynamically.
They exist in two visual tiers:

Tier 1 — Passive Highlights

Any card that, if traded, would complete a 5-card combo in the opposite deck glows softly.

Applies to combos already at 4 cards.

No limit to highlight count.

Combo	Example	Highlight?
Four of a Kind	Opposite deck has 3 Aces → highlight Aces here	✅
Full House	Opposite deck has 3 of X + 1–2 of Y → highlight completing card	✅
Flush	Opposite deck has 4 ♥ → highlight ♥ here	✅
Five of a Kind	Opposite deck has 4 same rank → highlight matching rank	✅
Others	(3 oak, 2 pair, straight, pair, high card)	❌
Tier 2 — Active Highlights (on Click)

When a highlighted card is clicked:

It gains a bright gold rim (active).

In the opposite deck, all cards forming that completed combo glow brighter.

Tooltip above those cards:
"Completes Flush → Right Deck" or "Completes Full House → Left Deck".

Tooltip fades after 2 s.

Click again to deselect.

Tier Differentiation
Tier	Glow	Border	Purpose
0	none	gray-200	default card
1	deck color + gold rim	thin	shows potential trade card
2	brighter (1.3×) + thick gold rim	active	shows confirmed combo cards
Visual Style

Left deck = inner blue #4DA6FF + gold #FFD700.

Right deck = inner magenta #FF4DD2 + gold rim.

Subtle 2 s pulse (opacity 0.8→1→0.8).

All cards are clickable, not just highlights.

Interaction Clarification

Clicking a non-highlighted card simply selects/deselects it (no cross-deck glow).

Clicking a highlighted card triggers Tier-2 response in the other deck.

Ensures players can freely click anywhere but only meaningful cards react.
